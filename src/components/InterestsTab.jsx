            <p>Apart from working to be a better developer, I enjoy most of my time playing basketball and going to the gym, focusing on body strength and overall fitness. Another big interest of mine, besides listening to music, is composing and producing it.</p>
           
            <p>My passion for music-making inspired me to connect the programming domain with the pleasure of being in a studio, writing music, and testing new sounds and audio plugins. This has led me to explore the fundamentals of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and work with frameworks like JUCE, Tone.js, and Reason's Rack Extensions SDK, as well as tools like Ableton, Reason, and Logic Pro X in a professional production studio environment</p>

            <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a keen interest in the fundamentals of cybersecurity, and I’m always eager to enhance my programming and coding knowledge through reading books and watching tutorials.</p>

            <p>I’m also a big fan of movies, particularly sci-fi and comedy series, and nothing beats enjoying a great burger while watching my favorite films—it's what I call "movie time!"</p>
