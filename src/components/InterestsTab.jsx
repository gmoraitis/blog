            <p>Apart from working to be a better developer, I enjoy most of my time playing basketball and going to the gym.
                Another big interest for me apart from listening is writing music.</p>
           
            <p>The interest in music-making gave me the idea to connect the programming domain with the pleasure of being in a studio writing music, 
                testing new sounds and audio plugins. 
                That's why I am trying to understand the fundamentals of DSP and working with frameworks like Juce,Tone.js and Reason's Rack Extensions SDK.</p>

            <p>I am a big fan of movies and especially sci-fi and comedy series. 
                The idea of having a nice burger watching my favorite movies its what I call "Its movie time!!"</p>

            <p>Reading programming books and watching tutorials makes the perfect match to add new pieces of information in my toolset.</p>
